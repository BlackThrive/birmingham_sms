## Overview

This Rproject contains the scripts and data necessary to produce the methods, procedure, and results for Black Thrive's Shared Measurement System analysis for Birmingham. 

The aim of this analysis is to quantify racial inequality in Birmingham by comparing various indicators for the Black population with the White population. Doing so makes it possible to identify the aspects of life in birmingham where inequality is manifest and to highlight where change is needed.

- RStudio 2021.09.0 Build 351 "Ghost Orchid"
- R version 4.1.1

### Packages required

The scripts use the following R packages. These need to be installed using <b>install.packages("</b>package name<b>")</b> if they are not already installed on your system.

#### Analysis script

- gmodels
- tidyverse
- ggrepel
- kableExtra
- epitools
- scales
- showtext

#### Stop and Search data retrieval script

- tidyverse
- jsonify
- leaflet
- httr

**stop_and_search_retrieval.Rmd**: Script for retrieving Stop and Search data from Police API based on boundary coordinates.

### Other

**images/btg_logo.png**: Black Thrive logo

## Setup

Once downloaded, unzip to a destination of your choice. Note that the Stop and Search data also needs to be unzipped, with the resulting csv file being located in the ***data*** directory. Be sure to retain the original folder structure.

Use **birmingham_sms.Rproj** to open project. 

To load the analysis script, use *File > Open File*, navigate to the ***scripts*** folder, and select **birmingham_sms_analysis.Rmd**. To run the script, select *Run > Run all* (Ctrl + Alt + R [Windows]; Cmd + Option + R[Mac]).

If you just want to view the knitted html document, using your system file navigator navigate to the scripts folder and open **birmingham_sms_analysis.html** in your preferred browser.

**stop_and_search_retrieval.Rmd** is the script used to extract data from the Police API. It is not necessary to run this script because its output is already provided in the data folder (**data/birmingham_stop_search_2020_09_2021_08.csv**).
